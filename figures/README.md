* Here are the codes used to process, analysis and visualize in this study.
* Figure1. Identification of partially hypermethylated regions.
* Figure2. Features of partially and fully hypermethylated UMRs.
* Figure3. Transcriptional patterns of phUMR and fhUMR related genes.
* Figure4. Differentially expressed phUMR and fhUMR related genes possess different chromatin features.
* Figure5. Partially hypermethylated UMRs accompanied by local changes of multiple histone modifications contributed to oncogene activation.
