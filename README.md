## phUMRs in IDH mutant gliomas
* Here are the codes used in the study "Partially erosion on under-methylated regions and chromatin reprogramming contribute to oncogene activation in IDH mutant gliomas".

## Identification of phUMR and fhUMR
<br/>
* In this study, we have developed a computational framework to identify aberrant hypermethylation at single-base resolution based on Hidden Markov Model.
